Trader:
As a trader you will be able to sell your resources to other players.
Use the RLM-Menu (Press 'L' to bring it up) and navigate to the 'My Job'-Tab.
In there you will find everything you need. You can advertise your shop with a 
public Servermessage, but it costs some of your hard earned money!

Doctor:
The doctor is one of the most important - yet difficult jobs to find.
To perform this job you will have to pass an examn which will teach you
how to create medicin out of herbs and how to use it - how to let broken bones
grow back together and how to reanimate a dead player. Once u have passed
the examn you can build up your own hospital. To start with the lessons
navigate to the 'My Job'-Tab

Der Beruf des Artztes is einer der wichtigsten und doch einer der schwersten 
Berufe die du dir aussuchen kannst
